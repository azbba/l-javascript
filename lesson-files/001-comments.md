# JavaScript comments

JavaScript provides two kinds of comments:

1. Single line comment
2. Multi-line Comments

## Single line comment

We can apply comments on a single line by using the // (double-slash).

```javascript
   // Single line comment
```

## Multi-line Comments

We can apply comments on multiple lines by using the `/* ... */`.

```javascript
   /**
    * Multi
    * line
    * Comments
    */
```
